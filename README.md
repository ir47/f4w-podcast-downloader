# F4WPodcastMassDownloader
Python script to download multiple podcasts from the F4W Online archive. 


Currently it is a pain to download podcasts from the F4W Online archive as each podcast has to be downloaded individually. The goal of this project is to be able to automate the download process and store the podcasts in a meaningful folder structure. 

Note: A valid subscription to F4W Online is required to use this tool. 


Goals of the Project:
  - Take in the podcast name and date range that is to be downloaded
  - Use a HTTP Request to download each of the podcasts
  - Store the downloaded podcasts in a passed in folder structure, either by date e.g. a new folder for each week, month or year 

Future Ideas:
  - Front end to enter information 
  - Ability to add in words to look for in a title to selectivley download episodes
  - Ability to select which podcasts to download in a range
